# Local Whisper Transcriber - Project Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a Chrome extension that uses Transformers.js to run OpenAI's Whisper AI model directly in the browser for speech-to-text transcription. The extension is designed with privacy in mind, processing all audio locally without sending any data to external servers.

## Key Features

- **100% Local Processing**: All transcription happens on the user's device
- **Multiple Model Options**: Support for various Whisper model sizes and languages
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use recording and transcription controls
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of transcribed text
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback during model loading and transcription
- **Settings Persistence**: Remembers the user's preferred model

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The extension follows a simple architecture:
- **Popup UI**: The main interface for user interaction
- **Background Service Worker**: Minimal service worker to keep the extension active
- **Transformers.js Integration**: For loading and running the Whisper model

### Technologies Used

- **Transformers.js**: For running the Whisper AI model in the browser
- **MediaRecorder API**: For capturing audio from the user's microphone
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: For storage and browser integration
- **ES Modules**: For modular JavaScript code
- **esbuild**: For bundling the JavaScript code

## Privacy Considerations

The extension is designed with privacy as a primary concern:
- All audio processing happens locally on the user's device
- No audio data is sent to any external servers
- The only network requests are to download the model files from Hugging Face (one-time)
- Models are cached locally after the initial download

## Performance Considerations

- **Model Size**: We offer different model sizes to balance accuracy vs. resource usage
- **Memory Usage**: Larger models require more memory (up to ~1GB for base models)
- **Processing Speed**: Transcription time varies based on model size and device capabilities
- **Storage**: Models are cached in IndexedDB, requiring up to 500MB for larger models

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:
- WebGPU acceleration for faster inference
- Continuous recording mode
- Timestamps for longer recordings
- Language detection
- Translation functionality
- Speaker diarization (who said what)
- Offline model management
- Transcript editing capabilities

## Conclusion

This extension demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to run sophisticated AI models directly in the browser, providing powerful functionality while maintaining user privacy. By leveraging Transformers.js and the WebAudio API, we've created a useful tool that respects user privacy by keeping all processing local.
